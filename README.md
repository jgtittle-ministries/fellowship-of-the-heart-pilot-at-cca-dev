## What's here

Three sequential series walked across a year of Tuesday evenings:

1. **Getting Started** — 10 weeks introducing the Four Connects.
2. **Going Deeper** — 12 weeks of the diagnostic, therapeutic, and developmental work of IJH Vol 2.
3. **Going Out** — 12 weeks discerning and equipping leaders to start formation groups of their own.

Plus the shared participant materials (Personal Heart Journal, Family Conversation Cards, Rhythm Card, Reading List).

The full reading experience is the site, not the repo. Open the [DEV preview site](https://jgtittle-ministries.github.io/fellowship-of-the-heart-pilot-at-cca-dev/) for the rendered content with navigation, search, and dark/light mode.
